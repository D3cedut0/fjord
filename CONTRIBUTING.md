# How to contribute

## Commits

* Follow existing coding style.

* Write [good commit messages].

* Make sure every commit compiles and that tests pass. This is very important
  for git bisect when tracking down bugs.

## Pull requests

* Make pull requests from feature branches, not from your master.

* Keep pull requests focused. Unrelated changes tend to make review and merge
  process more difficult.
